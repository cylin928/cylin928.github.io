	abstract = {The Crop-Hydrological-Agent Modeling Platform (PyCHAMP) is a Python-based open-source package designed for modeling agro-hydrological systems. The modular design, incorporating aquifer, crop field, groundwater well, finance, and behavior components, enables users to simulate and analyze the interactions between human and natural systems, considering both environmental and socio-economic factors. This study demonstrates PyCHAMP's capabilities by simulating the dynamics in the Sheridan 6 Local Enhanced Management Area, a groundwater conservation program in the High Plains Aquifer in Kansas. We highlight how a model, empowered by PyCHAMP, accurately captures human-water dynamics, including groundwater level, water withdrawal, and the fraction of cropland dedicated to each crop. We also show how farmer behavior, and its representation, drives system outcomes more strongly than environmental conditions. The results indicate PyCHAMP's potential as a useful tool for human-water research and sustainable groundwater management, offering prospects for future integration with detailed sub-models and systematic evaluation of model structural uncertainty.},

            Studies have recently focused on using coupled natural‐human systems (CNHS) to inform policymaking. However, model uncertainty can increase with model complexity and affect the variance of the model outcomes. Therefore, this study explores an uncertainty analysis of coupled hydrological and human decision models to better evaluate CNHS modeling properties. Five coupled models are proposed with different model complexities for human behavior settings (i.e., model structure and the number of calibrated parameters): one static, two adaptive, and two learning adaptive. Learning adaptive models (the most complex) have both a learning component (capturing long‐term trends) and an adaptive component (capturing short‐term variations), while adaptive models omit the learning component. The static model is the simplest, without learning or adaptive components. Applying the law of total variance, the model output uncertainty is decomposed into three sources: (a) climate change scenario uncertainty, (b) climate internal variability, and (c) different model configurations with parameter sets or model structures that are equally capable of producing similar outcomes. Our exploratory analysis demonstrated that model uncertainty would likely increase with model complexity given uncertain input data (e.g., climate forcing) and different model configurations; the inclusion of a learning mechanism in the human system can potentially offset the impact of the natural system on uncertainty through coupling natural and human systems. We also discuss other uncertainty sources, such as assumptions about model structure due to incomplete knowledge and metrics for calibration target selection for future studies.

            Plain Language Summary
            Recent studies have investigated connections between natural systems and related human impacts, such as those between the rainfall‐runoff process and agricultural activities. This is primarily performed by using two‐way connected, natural‐human computer models. However, these coupled models require many model parameters, which results in larger prediction uncertainty, especially when the observed data is limited. This study quantifies the relationship between model output uncertainty and model complexity. We found that, depending on the type of model used, the uncertainty of model outputs will likely increase with model complexity; however, active two‐way feedback between natural (e.g., streamflow) and human (e.g., water diversion) systems could offset the impact of the natural system on output uncertainty by increasing human variations. Note that such results were heavily influenced by corresponding model assumptions for human behaviors (e.g., how farmers will react to environmental feedback), which could be uncertain given incomplete knowledge. Therefore, continuously monitoring (i.e., acquiring data) and communicating uncertainty among modelers, policymakers, and other stakeholders is a necessary and worthy next step.

            The rise in smart water technologies has introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities for water infrastructures. However, the implications of cyber‐physical attacks on the systems like urban drainage systems remain underexplored. This research delves into this gap, introducing a method to quantify flood risks in the face of cyber‐physical threats. We apply this approach to a smart stormwater system—a real‐time controlled network of pond‐conduit configurations, fitted with water level detectors and gate regulators. Our focus is on a specific cyber‐physical threat: false data injection (FDI). In FDI attacks, adversaries introduce deceptive data that mimics legitimate system noises, evading detection. Our risk assessment incorporates factors like sensor noises and weather prediction uncertainties. Findings reveal that FDIs can amplify flood risks by feeding the control system false data, leading to erroneous outflow directives. Notably, FDI attacks can reshape flood risk dynamics across different storm intensities, accentuating flood risks during less severe but more frequent storms. This study offers valuable insights for strategizing investments in smart stormwater systems, keeping cyber‐physical threats in perspective. Furthermore, our risk quantification method can be extended to other water system networks, such as irrigation channels and multi‐reservoir systems, aiding in cyber‐defense planning.
