	abstract = {The Crop-Hydrological-Agent Modeling Platform (PyCHAMP) is a Python-based open-source package designed for modeling agro-hydrological systems. The modular design, incorporating aquifer, crop field, groundwater well, finance, and behavior components, enables users to simulate and analyze the interactions between human and natural systems, considering both environmental and socio-economic factors. This study demonstrates PyCHAMP's capabilities by simulating the dynamics in the Sheridan 6 Local Enhanced Management Area, a groundwater conservation program in the High Plains Aquifer in Kansas. We highlight how a model, empowered by PyCHAMP, accurately captures human-water dynamics, including groundwater level, water withdrawal, and the fraction of cropland dedicated to each crop. We also show how farmer behavior, and its representation, drives system outcomes more strongly than environmental conditions. The results indicate PyCHAMP's potential as a useful tool for human-water research and sustainable groundwater management, offering prospects for future integration with detailed sub-models and systematic evaluation of model structural uncertainty.},
