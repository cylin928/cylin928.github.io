Chung-Yi Lin, Ph.D., is a Postdoctoral Associate in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. His research examines the complex interactions among the natural environment, infrastructure, technology, and society to support risk-based decision-making and foster collaboration with diverse stakeholders. He employs system-based approaches, including agent-based modeling, data science, control, mathematical programming, and decision theory, to advance sustainable water resources management.

Before joining Cornell, Chung-Yi was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech. He holds a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from Lehigh University and an M.S. and B.S. in Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering from National Taiwan University.
